SSH Protocol Comparison Report
==========================

Connection Time:
  TCP: 0.0000 seconds
  UDP: 0.1019 seconds
  Winner: TCP

Data Transfer Efficiency:
  TCP: Sent 0 bytes, Received 0 bytes
  UDP: Sent 6118 bytes, Received 6357 bytes
  TCP Overhead Ratio: 0.00
  UDP Overhead Ratio: 0.96
  Winner (lower is better): TCP

Overall Recommendation:
  TCP is recommended for SSH implementation based on the benchmark results.
  Score: TCP 2, UDP 0

Protocol-Specific Observations:
  TCP:
  - Connection-oriented, reliable by design
  - Standard protocol for SSH, widely compatible
  - Better flow control and congestion handling
  - More overhead for connection establishment

  UDP:
  - Connectionless, requires custom reliability mechanisms
  - Non-standard for SSH, limited compatibility
  - Potentially lower latency for small packets
  - More prone to packet loss
